### Find maximum number of repetitions of a single character

We have the string with N characters, need to print the maximum number of repetitions of a single character , example:


Input:

    s = "d,fdfgmdfibmfidfvk,ofl,we34$dvdsvdfffffffffffffffdlf,dfl,dfl,dsfdd"

Output:

    ('f', 15)

You should implement function `get_max_repetitions`:

```python

def get_max_repetitions(s):
    # your logic
    return char, count
```
